                <h2>1. Ancient Origins</h2>
                <p>Mosquito nets have a long and fascinating history, dating back thousands of years. Evidence suggests that ancient Egyptians, including the renowned Cleopatra, used woven fabrics to shield themselves from insects. Similarly, in ancient Asia, particularly in China and India, silk and cotton nets were commonly used by both the wealthy and commoners. These early nets were not only functional but also symbols of status and luxury.</p>

           <p>The introduction of mosquito nets to Europe can be traced back to the Age of Exploration. Travelers and merchants brought back exotic materials, including netting, from their voyages to the East.

Today, they are primarily made from synthetic materials such as polyester and polyethylene, making them lightweight, durable, and affordable. Significant advancements include the development of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), which have proven highly effective in reducing the spread of mosquito-borne diseases.</p>
